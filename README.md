`AlgebraStreamFrames` provides Julia with structural algebra ORM for referencing out-of-memory data stored within files using indexing. The goal of this package is to streamline the use of data on disk by changing our processing approach. Instead of reading all of the data into memory, the data remains in the files and is only read on demand.
